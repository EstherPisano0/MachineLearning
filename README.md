Data Preprocessing 

Manipulation of data before it is analyzed

Data preprocessing can refer to manipulation, filtration or augmentation of data before it is analyzed, and is often an important step in the data mining process.

Includes roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and Research Scientist.

Skills in data preprocessing are highly valued in industries that rely on data-driven decision-making, including finance, healthcare, technology, and retail.

Data Scientist:
Responsibilities include preprocessing structured and unstructured data, implementing data preprocessing pipelines, and collaborating with data engineers to ensure high-quality data inputs for model training and validation.

Machine Learning Engineer: 
Tasks involve developing data preprocessing pipelines, handling large datasets, and ensuring data quality and accessibility for model training and deployment.

Research Scientist: 
Duties include designing and implementing data preprocessing techniques, developing tools and infrastructure for model training, and conducting comprehensive data management.
